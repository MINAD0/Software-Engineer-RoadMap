## Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Why?**: Optimize data processing and manipulation.
- **How?**: Use structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- **Problem to solve**: Improve efficiency in operations like searching and sorting.
- **Use Cases**: Search systems, databases, video games, networks.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Why?**: Facilitates modularity, code reuse, and complexity management.
- **How?**: Using objects with attributes and methods; concepts include inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Problem to solve**: Manage complexity in large software systems.
- **Use Cases**: Complex projects (Java, C++, Python).

### Core Principles
1. **Encapsulation**: Protect internal object data using access modifiers (private, protected, public).
2. **Inheritance**: Reuse code and establish class hierarchies using the `extends` keyword.
3. **Polymorphism**: Use a single interface to represent different object types via method overloading and overriding.
4. **Abstraction**: Hide implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.

## Software Design Patterns
- **Why?**: Solve recurring design problems and improve code readability.
- **How?**: Implement patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer.
- **Problem to solve**: Code reusability and clarity in system design.
- **Use Cases**: Complex software architectures.

### Types of Design Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**: Manage object creation (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
- **Structural Patterns**: Deal with class composition (e.g., Adapter, Composite).
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Manage object interactions (e.g., Observer, Strategy).

## Software Architecture
- **Why?**: Organize and structure software components for scalability and maintainability.
- **How?**: Adopt architectures like MVC, microservices, or monolithic structures.
- **Problem to solve**: Organize systems for performance and maintainability.
- **Use Cases**: Large applications, enterprise development.

### Types of Architectures
1. **Monolithic**: Single interconnected unit for easy development and deployment.
2. **Microservices**: Independent services that communicate via APIs.
3. **Layered Architecture**: Distinct layers for clear responsibilities.
4. **MVC**: Separates application into Model, View, and Controller components.

## Databases
- **Why?**: Store and organize data persistently.
- **How?**: Use relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
- **Problem to solve**: Efficient data management.
- **Use Cases**: Web applications, information systems.

### Types of Databases
- **SQL**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
- **NoSQL**: Document-based (e.g., MongoDB), Key-Value (e.g., Redis), Graph (e.g., Neo4j).

## APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- **Why?**: Enable communication between applications over the network.
- **How?**: Create endpoints for data exchange via HTTP.
- **Problem to solve**: Connect independent systems.
- **Use Cases**: Web development, mobile applications.

### Types of APIs
- **REST**: Lightweight, using HTTP verbs for resource interaction.
- **GraphQL**: Allows clients to request specific data.
- **WebSockets**: Bidirectional communication for real-time applications.
- **SOAP**: Formal protocol for structured information exchange.
- **gRPC**: High-performance framework for remote procedure calls.

## Agile Methodologies
- **Why?**: Adapt quickly to changes and deliver continuous value.
- **How?**: Use sprints, backlogs, and daily meetings.
- **Problem to solve**: Quickly respond to changing client needs.
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic environments, startups.

### Types of Methodologies
- **Scrum**: Uses fixed-duration sprints for rapid feature delivery.
  - **Key Roles**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team.
  - **Meetings**: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

## Software Testing
- **Why?**: Ensure software functions correctly and is bug-free.
- **How?**: Conduct unit, integration, and functional tests.
- **Problem to solve**: Ensure quality and reliability of software.
- **Use Cases**: Any development project.

## DevOps
- **Why?**: Automate deployments and tests to improve efficiency.
- **How?**: Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, Docker).
- **Problem to solve**: Deliver software quickly while ensuring quality.
- **Use Cases**: Large software projects, production environments.

### DevOps Practices
- **CI/CD**: Automates testing and deployments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automates infrastructure management.
- **Monitoring**: Ensures system availability and performance.
